   --run=multi                      Find and search all subdirectories and
                                    and run all the aflow.in without LOCK

   --run=N                          Find and search all subdirectories and
                                    and run the first N available aflow.in without LOCK.
                                    The old option --runone is mapped into --run=1.

   --mem=XX | --maxmem=XX           If XX is specified (considered in %), then aflow
                                    tries to kill all the vaspXX (and mpivaspXX) using
                                    more than XX% of the available RAM.
                                    The killing process is tried while printing "Messages"
                                    and "Temperature monitoring". Useful for the jobs managing.

   --use_aflow.in=XXX               Uses XXX instead of "aflow.in" in searching/running/operating directories.
                                    The option is very useful for compounded calculations.

   --use_LOCK=XXX                   Uses XXX instead of "LOCK" in freezing/searching/operating directories.
                                    The option is very useful for compounded calculations.
   --use_tmpfs=XXXX         Uses XXX instead of "/tmp" during AFLOW execution.

   --np=NUMBER  With MPI=ON (option or supercomputer defaults)
                aflow uses NUMBER as parameter for the MPI run.
                This declaration overrides the [AFLOW_MODE_MPI_MODE]NCPUS=XX 
                statement in the aflow.in file.

                With MPI=OFF
                aflow starts a NUMBER number of concurrent threaded runs within
                the "loop" search (--DIRECTORY=..) or the "file" table list (--FILE=..).
                For the multithread start, you have to enable multi.
                Examples:
                aflow --multi --np=32 --DIRECTORY=./ICSD_POOL
                aflow --multi --np=24 --FILE=./jobs2run

                With aconvasp.
                Some parts of aflow are multithreaded. If you specify
                --np=NUMBER, a NUMBER of independent threads will be
                launched to perform the task in a multitasking fashion.

   --npmax      With this option, aflow starts a number of concurrent runs
                equal to the maximun numbers of processors.

   --multish    Very useful option for scripting.
                if you have a "file" containing a gazillion of instructions,
                one per line, such as
                command_perform ./directory1
                command_perform ./directory2
                ......
                command_perform ./directory..
                then the instruction
                aflow --multish --np=XX --FILE file
                will pipe the instruction in a push-pop list and feed XX cpus in a
                multithreaded environment. You can susbtitute "--np=XX" with "--npmax"
                (or omit it at all) and use the max number of available cores in the
                machine. Instead of --FILE you can use " --F | -F | --f | -f".
                If you omit the --FILE option, then the last argument will
                be taken as the name of the file.
                Note that due to the variable nature of the time requested for each line,
                you might loose causality in the whole process (most of the times
                you do not need it, though).
                These are examples of proper commands:
                aflow --multish --np=12 --FILE file   (run file in 12 cores)
                aflow --multish --np=12 file          (run file in 12 cores)
                aflow --multish file                  (run file in all your cores)

   --multizip   Very useful option for scripting.
                aflow --multizip [--prefix=PREFIX] [--size=SSSS] [--add] --F file | -D directory1 directory2 ....
                if you have a huge amount of directories to zip then you can clusterize them, so that
                each subzip contains no more than SSSS entries.
                The "prefix=" is optional, the default is "m"
                The "size=" is optional, the default is 100.
                If you add  --add then, if zips are present, they will be added with the new files.
                This is a very useful option because many file systems do not allow big files.
                I usually use:
                aflow --multizip --prefix=magnetic --size=500 `find . -name EIGENVAL.bands.bz2`
                To make life easier, this option clears up the words
                "LOCK,aflow.in,OUTCAR.relax2.bz2,EIGENVAL.bands.bz2" from the directory names.

   --multibzip2 Very useful option for scripting.
                aflow --multibzip2 --np=XX --FILE file file2 file3....
                if you have a huge amount of files to bzip2 then you can multithread the bzip2 so there are XX (np) cores doing it concurrently.
                If --np=is not specified then the code will take 1 core.
                The filenames with ".bz2" extension are neglected.
   --multibunzip2 Very useful option for scripting.
                aflow --multibunzip2 --np=XX --FILE file.bz2 file2.bz2 file3.bz2....
                Same as --multibzip2 but for un-bzipping.
                The filenames without ".bz2" extension are neglected.
   --multigzip Very useful option for scripting.
                aflow --multigzip --np=XX --FILE file file2 file3....
                if you have a huge amount of files to gzip then you can multithread the gzip so there are XX (np) cores doing it concurrently.
                If --np=is not specified then the code will take 1 core.
                The filenames with ".gz" extension are neglected.
   --multibunzip Very useful option for scripting.
                aflow --multibunzip --np=XX --FILE file.gz file2.gz file3.gz....
                Same as --multigzip but for un-gzipping.
                The filenames without ".gz" extension are neglected.
   --multixzip Very useful option for scripting.
                aflow --multixzip --np=XX --FILE file file2 file3....
                if you have a huge amount of files to xzip then you can multithread the xzip so there are XX (np) cores doing it concurrently.
                If --np=is not specified then the code will take 1 core.
                The filenames with ".xz" extension are neglected.
   --multibunzip Very useful option for scripting.
                aflow --multibunzip --np=XX --FILE file.xz file2.xz file3.xz....
                Same as --multixzip but for un-xzipping.
                The filenames without ".xz" extension are neglected.

   --getTEMP [--runstat | --runbar | --refresh=X | --warning_beep=T | --warning_halt=T | --mem=XX ]
                If available, the command outputs the hostname and temperatures of the machine. Useful to find hardware issues:
                with --runstat the command continuously prints the temperature, refreshing every XX refresh seconds;
                with --runbar the command prints a bar with the temperature, refreshing every XX refresh seconds;
                with --refresh=X you can specify the refresh time (DEFAULT below)
                with --warning_beep=T, if the max temp goes beyond T(C, DEFAULT below), the command beeps the computer speaker;
                with --warning_halt=T, it the max temp goes beyond T(C, DEFAULT below), the command halts the computer (aconvasp must be run as root).
		with --max==X | --maxmem=XX, it kills vasp/mpivasp using more than XX% of memory.
                DEFAULT VALUES in .aflow.rc
                AFLOW_CORE_TEMPERATURE_BEEP=56.0  // Celsius
                AFLOW_CORE_TEMPERATURE_HALT=65.0  // Celsius, you need to run aflow as root to halt
                AFLOW_CORE_TEMPERATURE_REFRESH=5.0   // seconds

   --monitor [--mem=XX]
                This is a wrap up set of commands to be sent in the background so that the node is monitored for health/
                It kills vasp/mpivasp using more than XX% of memory.
		The default for XX is 95%/NCPUs, so even in the worst scenario there shoud be enough RAM to resuscitate
                a soon-to-be-frozen machine/node.

   --generate_aflowin_from_vasp
       ACTION:  Generates aflow.in from xCARs
       NOTE1:   You can add extra parameters to aflow.in by using
                --set "[KEYWORD]", where the keyword is one
                of the specified below. You can add as many as you want.
                Be careful: there is no check for inconsistency.
       NOTE2:   You can remove VASP files after the generation with the
                option --delete_xcars (remove all except aflow.in).

   --generate_vasp_from_aflowin | --generate
       ACTION:  Generates xCARs from aflow.in
       NOTE:    This option does not run any simulation.

   //DX and CO - START
   --generate_symmetry | --generate_sym
       ACTION:  Generates symmetry files: aflow.pgroup.out, aflow.fgroup.out, aflow.pgroup_xtal.out, aflow.iatoms.out, and aflow.agroup.out.
       NOTE:    This option does not run any simulation.
   //DX and CO - END

                OPTIONS, COMMAND, BINARY_DIRECTORY as listed in aflow_aflowrc.cpp

  SCRIPTING ORIENTED OPTIONS
   --cv         Explain this

*********************************************************************************
aflow.in

Aflow/aflowd reads lines starting with "[xxxx.." where xxx
is the command. If you put a character between "[" and "xxxx" like
"[!xxxx" the line is ignored. If you add a "#" at the beginning of a line
(such as "#[xxx"), everything on the left of # is ignored by aflow as
command/string/parameter (ignored by aflow does not mean ignored by the
binary code!). These features are useful if you want to generate a lot of
similar aflow.in's and you want to add/remove options in a very short time.


[AFLOW]				OPTIONAL
 everything on the left contains comments

[AFLOW_MODE=****]		MANDATORY
 Different modes of AFLOW running.
 [AFLOW_MODE]ALIEN is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE=ALIEN] is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE_ALIEN] is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE]VASP is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE=VASP] is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE_VASP] is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE]MATLAB is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE=MATLAB] is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE_MATLAB] is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE]ENCAPSULATED is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE=ENCAPSULATED] is supported
 [AFLOW_MODE_ENCAPSULATED] is supported

[AFLOW_MODE_ZIP=****] or [AFLOW_MODE_ZIP]****  OPTIONAL, Default in .aflow.rc
 Compression of output files at the end. You can write whatever
 you want as long as "command" is recognized.
 I suggest:
 [AFLOW_MODE_ZIP=none] does not compress
 [AFLOW_MODE_ZIP=xz]
 [AFLOW_MODE_ZIP=gzip]
 [AFLOW_MODE_ZIP=xz]

[AFLOW_MODE_BINARY=****] or [AFLOW_MODE_BINARY]**** OPTIONAL, Default in .aflow.rc
 the binary you want to start in each directory. If you put ./xxx
 you would start the exact binary in such directory.
 In MODE_VASP the default is vasp46s

[AFLOW_MODE_PRESCRIPT]                                OPTIONAL
 Execute everything after the keywords [AFLOW_MODE_PRESCRIPT]
 as a script BEFORE executing the AFLOW_MODE_BINARY simulations.
 The output of the script is piped into the aflow.prescript.out file.
 You need to watch for syntax and be careful with the commands.
 The script can also be contained between
  [AFLOW_MODE_PRESCRIPT]START
  script
  [AFLOW_MODE_PRESCRIPT]STOP

[AFLOW_MODE_POSTSCRIPT]                              OPTIONAL
 Execute everything after the keywords [AFLOW_MODE_POSTSCRIPT]
 as a script AFTER executing the AFLOW_MODE_BINARY simulations.
 The output of the script is piped into the aflow.postscript.out file.
 You need to watch for syntax and be careful with the commands.
 The script can also be contained between
  [AFLOW_MODE_POSTSCRIPT]START
  script
  [AFLOW_MODE_POSTSCRIPT]STOP

[AFLOW_MODE_EMAIL] or [AFLOW_MODE]EMAIL	              OPTIONAL
 Email the recipient address specified after the keyword
 [AFLOW_MODE_EMAIL] the output of the LOCK file once the
 prescript, simulations and postscripts are execute.
 WARNING: This keyword is not implemented yet.


********************************************************************************
HOST: fix default things for the HOST

 [AFLOW_HOST]MACHINE
  MACHINE=DUKE_BETA | DUKE_BETA_OPENMPI | DUKE_QRATS | DUKE_QFLOW | DUKE_X | DUKE_MATERIALS | 
                      DUKE_AFLOWLIB  | DUKE_HABANA | DOD_CONRAD | DOD_ONYX | DOD_GORDON | DOD_COPPER | 
                      DOD_GAFFNEY | DOD_KOEHR | DOD_MUSTANG | DOD_EULER |

                      FULTON_MARYLOU   | MACHINE1 |
  With this option, AFLOW takes the mpirun commands as specified in aflow_aflowr.cpp for this machine.
  MPI_COMMAND_XXXXXXX,  MPI_BINARY_DIR_XXXXXXX, sets up the AUTOTUNE (start,stop are neglected)
  and overrides the NCPUS value specified with the option --np=NUMBER (if specified)

********************************************************************************

[AFLOW_MODE_MPI]                OPTIONAL, default NONE
 Turns ON MPI parallel execution. Aflow will neglect the
 serial AFLOW_MODE_BINARY=binary.
 The computer should have already all the files to run
 mpi executables, such as hosts/.rhost/ etcetera.

[AFLOW_MODE_MPI_MODE]KEYWORD    OPTIONAL
 Keyword to specify parameters. After [AFLOW_MODE_MPI_MODE] you
 can put
 NCPUS=NNN           OPTIONAL, default NNN=4
  With NCPUS=0 or NCPUS=MAX aflow will try to guess the
  maximum number of cpus of the system by performing and
  analyzing the file /proc/cpuinfo as described in the note.
  With NNN=1 aflow will revert to SERIAL execution wih the
  AFLOW_MODE_BINARY=binary.
  Note: NCPUS=MAX goets through execution of the logical
  command `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -c "cpu MHz"`. It works
  on Linux installations with 2.6+ kernels. In case of troubles
  the default is _MPI_NCPUS_DEF_=4 specified in aflow_aflowrc.cpp.
  This is good for old alphas (I have a beautiful Alpha ES45
  with 4 CPUS. Stefano).
 START="string"      OPTIONAL, default ""
  The command you have to perform to start the mpi daemon.
  For LAM you have to execute "lamboot". For mpich1 or mpich2
  you have to specify something else.
 STOP="string"       OPTIONAL, default ""
  The command you have to perform to stop the mpi daemon.
  For LAM you have to execute "lamhalt". For mpich1 or mpich2
  you have to specify something else.
 COMMAND="string"    OPTIONAL, default "mpirun -np"
  The command you have to perform to execute the mpi executable.
  Usually it is "mpirun" but in some computers with multiple
  installations you might need to specify something else.
 AUTOTUNE            OPTIONAL
  If set, then aflow will neglect the PARALLEL MPI parameters
  in the input file and ajust them following the instructions
  of the code you are using.
  Note: this flag is currently used only for VASP and tunes
  LPLANE,NPAR,IALGO,LSCALU,NSIM as specified in the VASP manual
  for Linux Clusters.
 BINARY="string"     OPTIONAL, default "mpivasp46s"
  Specifies the mpi executable you are trying to run.

********************************************************************************
[AFLOW_MODE_QSUB]                OPTIONAL, default NONE
 Turns ON qsub (or other queue) systems. Aflow will go inside
 the directory and produce a file, "aflow.qsub.run",
 as described below.
 The file MUST organize the queue batch script and, at the
 end, should contain 'echo "DONE" > aflow.qsub.done'.
 Once the queue is submitted, the file "aflow.qsub.done" is
 checked every few minutes, until the string DONE is found and
 the simulation is considered finished. Check out the example
 below.

 [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE_**PLICIT]     MANDATORY, no default
  Only the EXPLICIT mode of QSUB is supported. Everything on
  the left of "[AFLOW_QSUB_FILE]" strings is copied into QSUB files.
  NOTE to [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE_EXPLICIT]
   With [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add:
   [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE_EXPLICIT]START  and
   [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP
   This helps because instead of specifying QSUB with the
   "[AFLOW_QSUB_FILE]" strings, everything between the ...]START
   and ...]STOP keys are copied inside a QSUB.
   This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long QSUBs
   without adding the "[AFLOW_QSUB_FILE]"
   strings ad the beginning of each line.

 [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE]COMMAND="string"  OPTIONAL, default "qsub"
  This is the command that is used to to submit a job
  The default is qsub but you can change it for your needs.

 [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE]PARAMS="string"  OPTIONAL, default nothing
  These are the parameters that are used to submit a job
  in the queue.

 NOTE: For MPI, the queue works in the same way, but the NCPUS=MAX
  should be avoided because aflow can not predict in which "note"
  the job will run (you might get as NCPUS the number of CPUS of the
  master node !!). My best suggestion is that you put NCPUS as the
  number you want.
  The MPI keywords, START/STOP/COMMAND/BINARY are neglected.
  You should prepare the "aflow.qsub.run" by yourself inside
  aflow.in as the example below shows.
  The MPI AUTOTUNE is performed, and this is very useful so
  the INCAR is automatically adapted for MPI jobs.

 NOTE2: I wrote some shortcuts for common used batch systems.
  With this parameters in aflow.in OR as command arguments,
  you can avoid writing long and tedious batch scripts inside
  the aflow.in
  [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE]MODE1  equal to aflow --gsub1
  [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE]MODE2  equal to aflow --gsub2
  [AFLOW_QSUB_MODE]MODE3  equal to aflow --gsub3
  (Mode1 is for Gus-Stefano Mg project in Marylou4)

[AFLOW_MODE=ALIEN] or [AFLOW_MODE_ALIEN] or [AFLOW_MODE]ALIEN

In MODE_ALIEN ***************************************
You do not need to create ALIEN code files
by hand. You can put everything inside aflow.in

[ALIEN_COMMAND]prog > output
 Contains the command to run, it can contain the program and the output.
 The input file can be contained in the EXPLICIT/IMPLICIT/EXTERNAL
 For long commands you can make a script with
  [ALIEN_COMMAND]START
  prog1_do_something
  prog2_do_something_else
  [ALIEN_COMMAND]STOP
 and all the output will be sent to "output". The START/STOP command
 overrides the simple "[ALIEN_COMMAND]prog > output" specification.

[ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_**PLICIT]
 Only the EXPLICIT mode of ALIEN is supported. Everything on
 the left of "[ALIEN_INPUT_FILE]" strings is copied into an "INPUT" file
 specified by the "INPUT=" keyword.
 NOTE to [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_EXPLICIT]
  With [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add:
  [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_EXPLICIT]START  and
  [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_EXPLICIT]STOP
  This helps because instead of specifying INPUT file with the
  "[ALIEN_INPUT_FILE]" strings, everything between the ...]START
  and ...]STOP keys are copied inside the INPUT file.
  This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long INPUT files
  without adding the "[ALIEN_FILE]"
  strings ad the beginning of each line.

[ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_EXTERNAL]
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command:
  [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/input
  or
  [ALIEN_INPUT_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/input.bz2
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard
 FILE=./input as default.

[ALIEN_INPUT_FILE_NAME]INPUT=
 Specifies the name of the input file for the general ALIEN program.
 If not specified, aflow takes "./input" as default

[ALIEN_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME]OUTPUT=
 Specifies the name of the output file for the general ALIEN program.
 If not specified, aflow takes "./output" as default

********************************************************************************
[AFLOW_MODE=MATLAB] or [AFLOW_MODE_MATLAB] or [AFLOW_MODE]MATLAB

In MODE_MATLAB ***************************************
You do not need to create MATLAB code files
by hand. You can put everything inside aflow.in

[AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_**PLICIT]     MANDATORY, no default
 Only the EXPLICIT mode of MATLAB is supported. Everything on
 the left of "[AFLOW_MATLAB_FILE]" strings is copied into an "aflow.m" file.
 This file is executed as "matlab -r aflow > aflow.out"
 (check the binary location in the aflow_aflowrc.cpp file) and
 the output is put in an "aflow.out" file.
 This is usefull to create structures with matlab.
 NOTE to [AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_EXPLICIT]
  With [AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add:
  [AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_EXPLICIT]START  and
  [AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP
  This helps because instead of specifying MATLAB code with the
  "[AFLOW_MATLAB_FILE]" strings, everything between the ...]START
  and ...]STOP keys are copied inside a MATLAB code.
  This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long MATLAB
  codes without adding the "[AFLOW_MATLAB_FILE]"
  strings ad the beginning of each line.

[AFLOW_MATLAB_MODE_EXTERNAL]
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command:
  [AFLOW_MATLAB_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/prog.m
  or
  [AFLOW_MATLAB_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/prog.m.bz2
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard
 FILE=./prog.m as default.

******************************************************
[AFLOW_SYMMETRY] or [VASP_SYMMETRY]KEYWORD    OPTIONAL
 Keyword to specify parameters. After [AFLOW_SYMMETRY]
 you can put
 CALCULATION         OPTIONAL
  With this keyword aflow calculates:
  * aflow.pgroup.out *: Point group of the lattice {R}
  * aflow.fgroup.out *: Factor group of the cell {R|t},
  note that this might not be a "true" group.
  * aflow.agroup.out *: Site point group for every atomic
  position (the maximum symmorphic subgrop of the lattice
  point group applied to each atomic point).
  * aflow.sgroup.out *: Space group {R|t+T} with T
  up to a radius from the origin.
  Files: the poing and factor groups are saved in
  aflow.pgroup.outand aflow.fgroup.out files. The site
  point group is saved in aflow.agroup.out.
  The aflow.sgroup.out file is not saves unless the
  following keyword is specified
 SGROUP_WRITE        OPTIONAL
  Flag, if present, the space group is saved in a file
  aflow.out.sgrop (use this with caution, the file might
  get huge)
 SGROUP_RADIUS=XXX   OPTIONAL, default XXX=5.0
  specifies the radius of a sphere around the origin
  where the translations of the space group is calculated.
  Be careful because the size of the space group increases
  as the radius^3 times the size of the factor roup.
 //DX and CO - START
 NO_SCAN             OPTIONAL
  The symmetry routine involves consistency checks. When
  a symmetry rule is broken, the tolerance is changed and 
  recalculated. This keyword will not perform the scan if
  symmetry rules are broken.
 SYM_EPS             OPTIONAL, default minimum_interatomic_distance/100.0
  Specifies the tolerance for all symmetry routines. 
  (In Angstroms).
 //DX and CO - END

******************************************************
[AFLOW_NEIGHBOURS]KEYWORD    OPTIONAL
 Keyword to specify parameters. After [AFLOW_NEIGHBOURS]
 you can put
 CALCULATION         OPTIONAL
 WRITE               OPTIONAL
 RADIUS=XXX          OPTIONAL, default XXX=5.0
 DRADIUS=XXX         OPTIONAL, default XXX=0.1

 Calculate anharmonic phonons. Read README_AFLOW_APL.TXT.

******************************************************
[AFLOW_MODE=VASP] or [AFLOW_MODE_MATLAB]

In MODE_VASP **************************************
You do not need to create INCAR/POSCAR/POTCAR/KPOINTS files
by hand. You can put everything inside aflow.in

[VASP_RUN]KEYWORDs .. where keywords can be

 GENERATE            OPTIONAL
  Generate all the files, and no vasp is generated. All the XCARs are generated and tuned accordingly
  (the original versions are backup in the XCARs.origs).

 STATIC		OPTIONAL
  Performs a STATIC run (different than RELAX=0).
  The keys IBRION,NSW,ISIF are commented in the INCAR file.

 KPOINTS              OPTIONAL
  Runs a swap of kpoints from the small to the prescribed ones so that the calculations
  relax faster (but run more relaxations). This option can be used for kpoints convergence.

 RELAX=N		OPTIONAL, Default N=2
  Selects the number of relaxations RELAX=N with N=0 to 99999 (many relaxations!).
  If N=0 then NO RUN is performed (XCARS are generated and twisted).

 RELAX_STATIC=N   	OPTIONAL, Default N=2
  Selects the number of relaxations RELAX_STATIC=N with N=0 to 99999 (many relaxations!).
  If N=0 then NO RUN is performed (XCARS are generated and twisted).
  After the N relaxations, a static run is performed with ad hoc INCARS.
  Look for RELAX_STATIC options for tuning the calculations.

 RELAX_STATIC_BANDS=N	OPTIONAL, Default N=2
  Selects the number of relaxations RELAX_STATIC_BANDS=N with N=0 to 99999 (many relaxations!).
  if N=0 then NO RUN is performed (XCARS are generated and twisted).
  After the N relaxations, a static run is performed with ad hoc
  INCARS.  After the STATIC run an BANDS canculation is performed.
  Look for RELAX_STATIC_BANDS options for tuning the calculations.
  You shall have a KPOINTS IMPLICIT and you must specify:
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]BANDS_LATTICE=fcc (cub,bcc,tet,bct,hex,orc,orci,orcc,orcf,rhl,tri,auto)
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]BANDS_GRID=16  (grid, thickness of vasp kpoints calcualations).
  with BANDS_LATTICE=AUTO aflows determines the lattice just before the static run

 STATIC_BANDS	              OPTIONAL
  A static run is performed with ad hoc  INCARS.  After the STATIC run
  an BANDS canculation is performed.
  Look for STATIC_BANDS options for tuning the calculations.
  You shall have a KPOINTS IMPLICIT and you must specify:
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]BANDS_LATTICE=fcc (cub,bcc,tet,bct,hex,orc,orci,orcc,orcf,rhl,tri)
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]BANDS_GRID=16  (grid, thickness of vasp kpoints calcualations).

 DIELECTRIC_STATIC (or DS)
  If a static calculation is present (RELAX_STATIC=N,RELAX_STATIC_BANDS=N,STATIC_BANDS) then
  the keyword preceed by a comma will switch to DIELECTRIC_STATIC calculations operating
  on the INCAR, through LRPA, LEPSILON, etc... The delta_K of the grid is choesen to be
  #define DIELECTRIC_DK 0.1  // aflow_ivasp.cpp
  It works only with vasp version > 5.2.
  Note that this drops the NPAR switch to allow k-points resampling so you must have a LOT of RAM,
  and set a large amount of stack ("ulimit -s unlimited"). If the code gets a MPICH error, it tries
  to circumvent it increasing the stack and decreasing the KPOINTS.
  Example:
  RELAX_STATIC_BANDS=2,DIELECTRIC_STATIC     // OR ..,DS
  will relax twice, perform the static calculations, get the bands, and run the static
  dielectric run.

 DIELECTRIC_DYNAMIC (or DD)
  If a static calculation is present (RELAX_STATIC=N,RELAX_STATIC_BANDS=N,STATIC_BANDS) then
  the keyword preceed by a comma will switch to DIELECTRIC_DYNAMIC calculations operating
  on the INCAR, through LRPA, LOPTICS, etc...
  If not selected, it forces the DIELECTRIC_STATIC to be done before, as it requires the
  dielectric_static wavefunction
  Example
  RELAX_STATIC_BANDS=2,DIELECTRIC_STATIC,DIELECTRIC_DYNAMIC     // OR ..,DS,DD
  will relax twice, perform the static calculations, get the bands, and run the static
  dielectric and then the final dynamic dielectric calculation.
  It works only with vasp version > 5.2.

 REPEAT_BANDS	              OPTIONAL
  This option is useful to repeat the band calculation after a previous
  relax*, static and band performance. All the relax and static is preserved.
  The INCAR.bands POTCAR.bands, and POSCAR.bands are preserved while the KPOINTS
  is re-generated to allow different path. You can force this option by copying
  LOCK into a file REPEAT_BANDS so aflow finds a new directory to run
  (otherwise you shall delete LOCK and add the option to aflow.in).

REPEAT_STATIC_BANDS	              OPTIONAL
  This option is useful to repeat the band calculation after a previous
  relax*, static and band performance. All the relax and static is preserved.
  The INCAR.static POTCAR.static, and POSCAR.static are preserved while the KPOINTS
  is re-generated to allow different path. You can force this option by copying
  LOCK into a file REPEAT_STATIC_BANDS so aflow finds a new directory to run
  (otherwise you shall delete LOCK and add the option to aflow.in).

REPEAT_DELSOL	              OPTIONAL
  This option is useful to repeat the delta-sol calculation after a previous
  static run. All *.static or *.static.bz2 files are preserved.
  The POSCAR.static, KPOINTS.static, POTCAR.static are copied to POSCAR, KPOINTS, POTCAR
  for the delta-sol run. The INCAR.static is reread and modified to include NELECT tag.
  N_0 = grep NELECT OUTCAR.static
  Then delta_N is calculated using scheme from ref PRL 105,196403 (2010), two delta-sol runs are performed
  (i) delta-sol plus (*.dsolp) with NELECT = N_0 + delta_N
  (ii) delta-sol minus (*.dsolm) with NELECT = N_0 - delta_N
  You can force this option by moving the LOCK file into a file named REPEAT_DELSOL
  so aflow finds a new directory to run
  (otherwise you shall delete LOCK and add the option to aflow.in).

NOTE: If you specify more than one GENERATE/STATIC/KPOINTS/RELAX/RELAX_STATIC
 runs, the priority is GENERATE (1), STATIC (2), BANDS (3), KPOINTS (4), RELAX (5).

--- INPUT FILES ---------------------------------------

For INCAR,KPOINTS,POSCAR,POTCAR you must choose one of the
available modes: EXPLICIT, IMPLICIT, EXTERNAL

*** INCAR *** *** INCAR *** *** INCAR *** *** INCAR ***
[VASP_INCAR_MODE_**PLICIT]
 EXPLICIT and IMPLICIT mode of INCAR are supported.
 In EXPLICIT mode everything on the left of "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]"
 strings is copied into INCAR files.
 NOTE to [VASP_INCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]
  With [VASP_INCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add:
  [VASP_INCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]START  and
  [VASP_INCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP
  This helps because instead of specifying INCAR with the
  "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, everything between the ...]START
  and ...]STOP keys are copied inside a INCAR.
  This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long INCARs
  without adding the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]"
  strings ad the beginning of each line.
 In IMPLICIT mode the keyword "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]SYSTEM_AUTO"
 indicates aflow to take system, prototype and info names from
 the POSCAR (available if taken from the databases).
 NOTE after the EXPLICIT and IMPLICIT constructions, aflow fixes
 the INCAR following the FORCE_OPTIONS keyword specified below.


[VASP_INCAR_MODE_EXTERNAL]
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command:
  [VASP_INCAR_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/INCAR
  or
  [VASP_INCAR_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/INCAR.relax2.bz2
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard
 FILE=./INCAR as default.

*** KPOINTS *** *** KPOINTS *** *** KPOINTS *** *** KPOINTS ***
[VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_**PLICIT]
  Both EXPLICIT and IMPLICIT are supported.
  IMPLICIT:  Everything after the line containing
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE] will be used to create the KPOINTS file.
  Options are
  KMODE=X      # MODE OF THE KPOINTS (same as second line of KPOINTS)
  KPPRA=XXXX   # number of kpoints times the size of unit cell
                 the grid is calculated with the function KPPRA
  KSCHEME=Monkhorst-Pack  (or Gamma)# Kpoints scheme. The ones of VASP are
               supported and you can use only 1 letter.
          You can specify KSCHEME=AUTO (actually you need only =A)
          and aflow takes 'G' for FCC/HEX lattices and 'M' otherwise
  KSHIFT=X X X # the three shift to bring in/out the Gamma point
               see manual
  You can override the KPOINT generation only for the STATIC phase by enforcing:
  STATIC_KMODE=X               # see KPOINTS for explanation
  STATIC_KPPRA=XXXX            # see KPOINTS for explanation
  STATIC_KSCHEME=Monkhorst-Pack# see KPOINTS for explanation
  STATIC_KSHIFT=X X X          # see KPOINTS for explanation

 EXPLICIT: Everything after the line containing
 [VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXPLICIT] will be used to generate the KPOINTS
 file. Hence this string should be used once and just before the
 KPOINTS information.
 NOTE to [VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXPLICIT]
  With [VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add:
  [VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXPLICIT]START  and
  [VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP
  This helps because instead of specifying KPOINTS with the
  "[VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]" strings, everything between the ...]START
  and ...]STOP keys are copied inside a KPOINTS file.
  This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long KPOINTSs
  without adding the "[VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]"
  strings ad the beginning of each line.

[VASP_KPOINTS_MODE_EXTERNAL]
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command:
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/KPOINTS
  or
  [VASP_KPOINTS_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/KPOINTS.relax2.bz2
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard
 FILE=./KPOINTS as default.

*** POSCAR *** *** POSCAR *** *** POSCAR *** *** POSCAR ***
[VASP_POSCAR_MODE_**PLICIT]
 EXPLICIT and IMPLICIT modes of POSCAR are supported.
 In EXPLICIT mode everything on the left of "[VASP_POSCAR_FILE]"
 strings is copied into POSCAR files.
 NOTE to [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]
  With [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT] activated, you can add:
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]START  and
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP
  This helps because instead of specifying POSCAR with the
  "[VASP_POSCAR_FILE]" strings, everything between the ...]START
  and ...]STOP keys are copied inside a POSCAR.
  This option is very useful trick to cut/paste long POSCARs
  without adding the "[VASP_POSCAR_FILE]"
  strings ad the beginning of each line.
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]START.AAA
   ...
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP.AAA
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]START.BBB
   ...
  [VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP.BBB
  aflow generates directories ARUN.AAA ARUN.BBB ... and runs them all
  with the same parameters but dirrerent POSCARS

 In IMPLICIT mode, commands are given to generate structures.
 The first must be the keywork "PROTOTYPE=", then we can have
 "SPECIES=" and "VOLUMES=". Keywords are separated by ";", while
  values are separated by ",".
 PROTOTYPE=label identifies the label on the DMQC-HTQC or GUS
  database of prototypes.
 SPECIES=specieA,specieB,... identifies the atomic species.
  You can add the "_pv", "_sv".. etc which is used for the POTCAR
  atomatic generation.
 VOLUMES=volumeA,volumeB,... identifies the volume per atom
  of each specie and the overall volume of the cell is the sum
  of each individual volumes (Vegard`s law).
  If you specify only one volume, as
  "VOLUME=volume", then the cell will be forced to have that
  volume per atom (aflow takes "volume" and multiply times the
  number of atoms in the cell).
  If you do not specify any volume, then the CELL volume will
  be taken from the closed packed atomic volume (fcc through
  VASP) and averaged with the Vegard`s law.
 Example
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]PROTOTYPE=5;VOLUMES=20,10;SPECIES=Ag,Zr_sv;
 You can change/force the volume created by PROTOTYPE with
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]VOLUME=xxx
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]VOLUME+=xxx
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]VOLUME*=xxx

[VASP_POSCAR_MODE_EXTERNAL]
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command:
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/POSCAR
  or
  [VASP_POSCAR_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/CONTCAR.relax2.bz2
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard
 FILE=./POSCAR as default.

*** POTCAR *** *** POTCAR *** *** POTCAR *** *** POTCAR ***
[VASP_POTCAR_MODE_**PLICIT]     MANDATORY, no default
 IMPLICIT: The "POTCAR" potential files specified after the
 "[VASP_POTCAR_FILE]" strings are copied into POSCAR files.
 If you specify the keyword "[VASP_POTCAR_FILE]SYSTEM_AUTO"
 then aflow will extract the species names from the POSCAR
 (stored inside the structure generation) adding before and after
 the PREFIX and SUFFIX as:
 [VASP_POTCAR_FILE]PREFIX=$POTCARDIR/pot_LDA/current/
 [VASP_POTCAR_FILE]SUFFIX=/POTCAR
 This option is very powerful for atomatic generation of
 calculations.

 EXPLICIT: Everything after the line containing
 [VASP_POTCAR_MODE_EXPLICIT] will be used to generate the POTCAR
 file. Hence this string should be used once and just before the
 POTCAR information.

[VASP_POTCAR_MODE_EXTERNAL]
 Searches a file or loads a file from stdout command:
  [VASP_POTCAR_FILE]FILE=../../somewhere/POTCAR
  or
  [VASP_POTCAR_FILE]COMMAND=bzcat ../somewhere/CONTCAR.relax2.bz2
 if FILE or COMMAND are not specified, aflow takes the standard
 FILE=./POTCAR as default.

--- FORCE OPTIONS ---------------------------------------

[VASP_FORCE_OPTION]KEYWORD
 Force some parameters for VASP calculation, changing the input files
 approptiately. They are all OPTIONALS. Possible keywords are:

 NOTUNE
  Aflow/aflowd does not perform any modification of the input files so it
  neglect all the FORCE_OPTIONs parameters.

 SYSTEM_AUTO
  Adapt INCAR adding the system, prototype and info names from
  the POSCAR (available if taken from the databases).

 STATIC
  Adapt INCAR to perform a static run (IBRION,NSW,ISIF are commented).
  You can mix RUN_RELAX and STATIC options to get particular behaviors.

 RELAX || RELAX_ALL
  Adapt INCAR to perform a relaxed run adapting (default MODE_ENERGY)
  IBRION=2      # relax with Conjugate Gradient
  NSW=51        # relax for long
  ISIF=3        # relax everything
  but without specifying the way to add.

 RELAX_IONS
  Adapt INCAR to perform a run in which only IONS are relaxed.

 RELAX_CELL_SHAPE
  Adapt INCAR to perform a run in which only CELL_SHAPE is relaxed.

 RELAX_CELL_VOLUME
  Adapt INCAR to perform a run in which only CELL_VOLUME is relaxed.

 RELAX_IONS_CELL_VOLUME
  Adapt INCAR to perform a run in which only IONS_CELL_VOLUME is relaxed.
  Vasp does not support relaxation of IONS and VOLUME at the same time so
  aflow runs alternate relaxations volume/ions (relaxODD/relaxEVEN). I suggest
  to bump up N in [RELAX=N] so you achieve better convergence.

 RELAX_MODE=ENERGY   (DEFAULT)
  Adapt INCAR to perform a relaxed run minimizing the total energy
  IBRION=2       # relax with Conjugate Gradient
  NSW=51         # relax for long
  ISIF=3         # relax everything

 RELAX_MODE=FORCES
  Adapt INCAR to perform a relaxed run minimizing all the forces
  NELMIN=4       # The forces have to be well converged
  ADDGRID=.TRUE. # To support finer forces calculation
  EDIFFG=-1E-5   # The final structure has to have zero forces!
  IBRION=1       # More stable algorithm
  NSW=100        # relax for very long
  ISIF=3         # relax everything
  If RELAX_MODE_FORCES and RELAX_MODE_ENERGY are both (or none) specified,
  the derault is to take RELAX_MODE_ENERGY.

 PREC= LOW | MEDIUM | NORMAL | HIGH | ACCURATE), PRESERVED
 PREC=LOW  (PREC=LOW)
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enhance precision by tuning the parameters:
  ENMAX = XXXX         # 1.0 ENMAX of pseudopotentials
  PREC  = low          # reduce wrap around errors
  Note: the 1.0 can be changed in .aflow.rc (DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_ENMAX_MEDIUM).

 PREC=MEDIUM  (PREC=MEDIUM) 
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enhance precision by tuning the parameters:
  ENMAX = XXXX         # 1.3 ENMAX of pseudopotentials
  PREC  = med          # reduce wrap around errors
  Note: the 1.3 can be changed in .aflow.rc (DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_ENMAX_MEDIUM).

 PREC=NORMAL  (PREC=NORMAL)
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enhance precision by tuning the parameters:
  ENMAX = XXXX         # 1.3 ENMAX of pseudopotentials
  PREC  = normal       # reduce wrap around errors
  Note: the 1.3 can be changed in .aflow.rc (DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_ENMAX_NORMAL).

 PREC=ACCURATE  (or PREC=HIGH or PREC=ACCURATE) (default=ACCURATE if not specified)
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enhance precision by uning the parameters:
  ENMAX = XXXX         # 1.4 ENMAX of pseudopotentials
  PREC  = Accurate     # avoid wrap around errors
  LREAL = .FALSE.      # reciprocal space projection technique
  EDIFF = 1E-6         # high accuracy required
  ALGO  = Fast         # fast determination of ground state
  Note: the 1.4 can be changed in .aflow.rc (DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_ENMAX_HIGH).
 PREC=PRESERVED
  When AFLOW switches from relax to static and to bands, the PREC is preserved and not changed accordingly. Good for calculations with
  PREC conserved through the task.

 AUTO_PSEUDOPOTENTIALS=pot_LDA | pot_GGA | potpaw_LDA | potpaw_GGA | potpaw_PBE | potpaw_LDA_KIN | potpaw_PBE_KIN 
  Aflow will take the standardized pseudopotential of the specified type associated to the species described in the POTENTIAL part of the aflow.in.
  The default is the value specified in .aflow.rc DEFAULT_VASP_PSEUDOPOTENTIAL_TYPE=potpaw_PBE

 ENMAX_MULTIPLY=NUMBER (default is DEFAULT_VASP_PREC_ENMAX_LOW, _MEDIUM, _NORMAL, _HIGH, _ACCURATE see .aflow.rc
  Force the user choice of MULTIPLIER of the max_cutoff of pseudopotentials. Usually 1.2-1.4. 
  Increase to 1.5 or higher for high-pressure calculations.

 ALGO=(NORMAL | VERYFAST | FAST | ALL | DAMPED), PRESERVED
 ALGO=XXXXXX
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow re-adapts INCAR to enforce ALGO=XXXXXX tuning the parameter
  ALGO and removing IALGO.
  ALGO = XXXXXX        # ALGO - XXXXXX
   XXXXX can be NORMAL | VERYFAST | FAST | ALL | DAMPED
 ALGO_PRESERVED
  When AFLOW switches from relax to static and to bands, the ALGO is preserved and not changed to "normal". Good for calculations which
  relax correctly but crash on the static part.

METAGGA=TPSS | RTPSS | M06L | MBJL | SCAN | MS0 | MS1 | MS2 | NONE
 METAGGA=XXXXXX
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enforce METAGGA=XXXXXX tuning the parameter
  METAGGA = XXXXXX        # METAGGA = XXXXXX
   XXXXX can be TPSS | RTPSS | M06L | MBJL | SCAN | MS0 | MS1 | MS2 | NONE
   If NONE or nothing is specified, the METAGGA keyword is not  included in the INCAR.

IVDW=number_for_VASP_see_manual_for_IVDW
 IVDW=XXXXXX
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to enforce IVDW=XXXXXX tuning the parameter
  IVDW = XXXXXX        # IVDW = XXXXXX
   XXXXX can be a number specified in https://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/vasp/IVDW_approximate_vdW_correction_methods.html
   If 0 or nothing is specified, the VDW keyword is not  included in the INCAR.
   Note that other parameters might have to be specified in the INCAR part of aflow.in by the user

 NBANDS
  After INCAR is generaged by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd extimates the number of NBANDS and add the informaiton
  to the proper input files.
 NBANDS=XXXX
  After INCAR is generaged by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd used XXXX as number of bands. This is useful for automatic correction and restart.
  If the entry exists, it will override the original INCAR specification of the user.

 PSTRESS=XXXX  (in kB) (PRESSURE)
  After INCAR is generaged by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd adapts it for pressure calculations with PSTRESS=XXX.
  If the entry exists, it will override the original INCAR specification of the user.

 EDIFFG=XXXX  (convergence for forces)
  After INCAR is generaged by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd adapts it for relaxed forces calculations with EDIFFG=XXX.
  If the entry exists, it will override the original INCAR specification of the user.

 NEGLECT_NOMIX
  The run is not performed if the system is known to be immiscible.
  The list of immiscibles are in aflow_nomix.cpp.

 SPIN=ON
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include SPIN.
  If no SPIN is mentioned the INCAR spin part remains untouched.
 SPIN=OFF
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude SPIN.
  If no SPIN is mentioned the INCAR spin part remains untouched.
 SPIN=REMOVE_RELAX_1
  After 1 RELAXATION is performed, if there is no spin in the calculation,
  the spin is turned off automatically to save computer time and
  make relaxations easier. Default cutoff is 0.025 specified in aflow_aflowrc.cpp
  (DEFAULT_VASP_SPIN_REMOVE_CUTOFF)
 SPIN=REMOVE_RELAX_2
  After 2 RELAXATIONS are performed, if there is no spin in the calculation,
  the spin is turned off automatically to save computer time and
  make relaxations easier. Default cutoff is 0.025 specified in aflow_aflowrc.cpp
  (DEFAULT_VASP_SPIN_REMOVE_CUTOFF)

 BADER=ON | OFF (default OFF)
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include BADER analysis (LAECHG). 
  It works only on the STATIC part of a run. RELAX_STATIC and RELAX_STATIC_BANDS 
  have this option automatic.
  By specifying OFF, aflow will strip the INCAR of any BADER related instruction.

 ELF=ON | OFF (default OFF)
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include the Electron Localization Function (ELF) analysis (LELF). 
  It works only on the STATIC part of a run.
  By specifying OFF, aflow will strip the INCAR of any ELF related instruction.

 LSCOUPLING=ON
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include LSCOUPLING.
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options.
  LSORBIT=.TRUE.
  LNONCOLLINEAR=.TRUE.
  It does not touch SAXIS = s_x s_y s_z so the default (0+,0,1) is kept,
  unless you specify something dufferent in the INCAR part of aflow.in
  ("0+" implies an infinitesimal small positive number in x direction).
  With LSCOUPLING=ON MAGMOM is adapted as a vector for each atom.
  When you're doing non-collinear calculations you have to specify a
  vector for each atom, i.e. three entries per atom. So if you have N
  ions you therefore will have to have 3N elements on the MAGMOM-line
  which are the projections onto the chosen SAXIS.
  NOTE: with LSORBIG and LNONCOLLINEAR calculations VASP must be compiled
  without the option -DNGZhalf and -DNGXhalf.
  AFLOW expects the executable to be called as "BIN"+"LS", therefore
  if you specify "mpivasp46s", the LS run will be performed calling "mpivasp46sLS".
 LSCOUPLING=OFF
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude LSCOUPLING.
  LSORBIT=.FALSE.
  LNONCOLLINEAR=.FALSE.
  MAGMOM is not touched and is left to be specified by AUTO_MAGMOM
  or by the INCAR part of aflow.in.

 AUTO_MAGMOM=ON
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include AUTO_MAGMOM.
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options.
 AUTO_MAGMOM=OFF
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude AUTO_MAGMOM.
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options.

 SYM=ON
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include SYMMETRY (ISYM=2).
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options.
 SYM=OFF
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude SYMMETRY (ISYM=0).
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options.

 KPOINTS=EVEN | ODD 
  Aflow makes KPOINTS even/odd.
 KPOINTS=KSHIFT_GAMMA_EVEN | _ODD
  Aflow shift of 1/2 the K points that are even/odd.
 KPOINTS=GAMMA
  Aflow sets [1 1 1] K points. You should specify the correct BINARY for the
  the gamma point calculation (faster) otherwise aflow will run the normal vasp.
 KPOINTS=KSCHEME_MONKHORST_PACK
  Aflow forces Monkhorst-Pack Kscheme
 KPOINTS=KSCHEME_GAMMA
  Aflow forces Gamma Kscheme
 KPOINTS=KSCHEME_AUTO
  Aflow forces Kscheme to be Gamma for FCC/HEX lattices and Monkhorst-Pack for everything else.
 KPOINTS=IBZKPT
  Aflow uses IBZKPT.relax1 to proceed for relaxations >=2.

 WAVECAR=ON
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include WAVECAR. (LWAVE = .TRUE.)
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options.
 WAVECAR=OFF
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude WAVECAR. (LWAVE = .FALSE.)
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options.

 CHGCAR=ON
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include CHGCAR. (LCHARG = .TRUE.)
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options.
 CHGCAR=OFF
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude CHGCAR. (LCHARG = .FALSE.)
  If you have good INCARs, you do not need to play with these options.

 CHGCAR_FILE=XXXX (XXXX = path to file)
   Uses the CHGCAR file this option is set to to start the VASP calculation.
   ICHARG is set to 1 when this option is set. If the run type is a relaxation
   calculation, the CHGCAR file will only be used for the first one. ICHARG
   is then set to 2 for the subsequent relaxations.

 RWIGS_STATIC
  When running a STATIC calculation (STATIC, RELAX_STATIC, RELAX_BAND_STATIC)
  it extracts RWIGS from the POTCAR (and forces LORBIT=0)

 TYPE=METAL or TYPE=INSULATOR or TYPE=SEMICONDUCTOR or TYPE=DEFAULT
  Aflow arranges the integration method of the Brillouin Zone for Metals or
  Insulators/Semiconductors by tuning ISMEAR and SIGMA. Look at the manual.
  This key is very important for forces calculations (not really for bulk energies)
  since the tetrahedron method with Blochl corrections is NOT variational
  in the forces, so the answers might be wrong in some cases.
  ISMEAR = 2     # default (hope)
  SIGMA = 0.2    # default (hope)
  ISMEAR = 1     # for metals
  SIGMA = 0.1    # for metals
  ISMEAR = 0     # for insulators/semiconductors
  SIGMA = 0.05   # for insulators/semiconductors
  This keyword is MANDATORY if you are doing phonons calculations.

 ISMEAR=XXXX  (smearing)
  After INCAR is generaged by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd adapts it for relaxed forces calculations with ISMEAR=XXX.
  If the entry exists, it will override the original INCAR specification of the user.
  This will override what is specified by TYPE.
 
 SIGMA=XXXX  (smearing)
  After INCAR is generaged by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings, aflow/aflowd adapts it for relaxed forces calculations with SIGMA=XXX.
  If the entry exists, it will override the original INCAR specification of the user.
  This will override what is specified by TYPE.

 LDAU1=ON   | OFF | ADIABATIC | CUTOFF
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include LDAU in the mode 1 of VASP.
  You need to specify the species with the keyword.
  With ADIABATIC it turns on LDAU adiabatically through the relaxN steps.
  If n is the max number of relaxes and j is the step then the U and J parameters are
  set as j/n*(U,J) per calcuation. The minimum step of ADIABATIC relaxations is set
  up to be LDAU_ADIABATIC_RELAX_DEFAULT=6, and can  be modified in aflow_kvasp.cpp
  With CUTOFF, aflow adds an extra relaxation step (RELAX++). The extra step is performed
  with a recycled CHGCAR of the previous step, static, and turning off all LDAU calculations.
  This is very useful to canculate non LDAU energies with LDAU charge distributions.

 LDAU2=ON   | OFF | ADIABATIC | CUTOFF
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to include LDAU in the mode 2 of VASP.
  You need to specify the species with the keyword.
  With ADIABATIC it turns on LDAU adiabatically through the relaxN steps.
  If n is the max number of relaxes and j is the step then the U and J parameters are
  set as j/n*(U,J) per calcuation. The minimum step of ADIABATIC relaxations is set
  up to be LDAU_ADIABATIC_RELAX_DEFAULT=6, and can  be modified in aflow_kvasp.cpp
  With CUTOFF, aflow adds an extra relaxation step (RELAX++). The extra step is performed
  with a recycled CHGCAR of the previous step, static, and turning off all LDAU calculations.
  This is very useful to canculate non LDAU energies with LDAU charge distributions.

  To specify the parameters, you can have AFLOW to choose for you
  with LDAU_SPECIES of do by hand through LDAY_PARAMETERS.
 LDAU_SPECIES=Cu La O Ru    (separated by spaces, no commas) so that aflow
  picks the right parameters from the AVASP_Get_LDAU1_Parameters() routine (aflow_avasp.cpp).
  If no LDAU_SPECIES are present, you have to specify LDAUL, LDAUU, LDAUJ manually
  in the INCAR.
 LDAU_PARAMETERS=speciesA,speciesB..;L_A,L_B..;U_A,U_B..;J_A,J_B...
  for example (groups separated by ";" while entries separated by ",")
  Cu,La,O,Ru;0,2,1,-1;0.0,4.2,1.1,0.0;0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
  where
  Cu,La,O,Ru       LDAU set of species
  0,2,1,-1         LDAU orbitals with -1,0,1,2,3 = none,s,p,d,f
  0.0,4.2,1.1,0.0  LDAU Us for species
  0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0  LDAU Js for species
  Note: LDAU_PARAMETERS overrides LDAU_SPECIES.

 LDAU=OFF | LDAU1=OFF | LDAU2=OFF
  After INCAR is generated by the "[VASP_INCAR_FILE]" strings,
  aflow/aflowd re-adapts INCAR to exclude all LDAU calculations.


 CONVERT_UNIT_CELL=STRING1,STRING2,... etc where STRINGS can be

  STANDARD_PRIMITIVE | STD_PRIM | SPRIM
   Converts the unit cell to the standard primitive form as described
   by the rules in the aflow_kpoints.cpp file and in the README_LATTICE file
   If specified, it turns off  NIGGLI, MINKOWSKI, INCELL, COMPACT, WIGNERSEITZ.
   If both STANDARD_PRIMITIVE and STANDARD_CONVENTIONAL then PRIMITIVE has priority.
   REF: Setyawan Curtarolo, DOI: 10.1016/j.commatsci.2010.05.010
  STANDARD_CONVENTIONAL | STD_CONV | SCONV
   Converts the unit cell to the standard primitive form as described
   by the rules in the aflow_kpoints.cpp file and in the README_LATTICE file
   If specified, it turns off  NIGGLI, MINKOWSKI, INCELL, COMPACT, WIGNERSEITZ.
   If both STANDARD_PRIMITIVE and STANDARD_CONVENTIONAL then PRIMITIVE has priority.
   REF: Setyawan Curtarolo, DOI: 10.1016/j.commatsci.2010.05.010
  NIGGLI
   Converts the unit cell to the standardized Niggli form.  The
   form is unique (up to some signs, I think).  The transformation
   makes use of only the lattice vectors and does not depend on the
   basis atoms.  This will work on any cell, but it treats the given
   cell as primitive, and it will not reduce the cell to primitive
   if it is not primitive already.  At present the algorithm seems to
   hang if I force more than about 6 digits of accuracy so be aware that
   small errors might be introduced (these can break symmetry!).
   (Written by Dane Morgan).
  MINKOWSKI | MINK
   Converts the unit cell with the Minkowski reduction
   This routine takes a set of basis vectors (that form a lattice)
   and reduces them so that they form the shortest possible basis.
   The reduction is performed so that each vector "a_i" is a close
   as possible to the origin while remaining in the affine plane which
   is defined by "a_j", "a_k" but shifted by "a_i", for any choice
   of even permutations of i,j,k in 1,2,3.

  INCELL
   Convert the basis with all atoms mapped to their images within
   the unit cell.
  COMPACT
   Convert the basis with all atoms mapped through the unit and neighbours
   cells to minimixe the shortest possible bond with an adjacent atom
   This option is very useful if you run big and complicate
   molecules where atoms exit of the unit cell and you have
   problems understanding where they are because visualization
   packages do not show bonds anymore ...
  WIGNERSEITZ | WS
   Convert the basis with all atoms mapped to their images within
   the Wigner Seitz cell.
  CARTESIAN | CART
   Convert the basis set to Cartesian coordinates.
  FRACTIONAL  | DIRECT | FRAC | DIR
   Convert the basis set to fractional coordinates.
  PRESERVE | PRES
   Preserve the POSCAR from being Standardized (Primitive or Coventional).

 VOLUME=xxx
 VOLUME+=xxx
 VOLUME*=xxx
  Change the volume of the POSCAR accordingly (fix, +=, *=) as in the c,c++ standard.

--- FROZSL OPTIONS ---------------------------------------
[AFLOW_FROZSL]CALC
 Generate the POSCARS starting from the FROZSL input file (the long one you
 generate from the web). It uses a PERL script to parse the frozl part and
 then generates the poscars. Then it runs then, exctract the energies, remove the minima,
 transform in hartree and pring everything in aflow.frozsl_energies.out
 The FROZSL file is defined as everything after the [AFLOW_FROZSL]CALC line.

[AFLOW_FROZSL]DOWNLOAD | [AFLOW_FROZSL]DOWN

 and, optionally,
 [FROZSL_MODE_EXPLICIT]START.FROZSL_DIELECTRIC
 xxx
 [FROZSL_MODE_EXPLICIT]STOP.FROZSL_DIELECTRIC
 download the FROZSL output  by using "wget" and does the calculation
 as specified in the FROZSL code. The FROZSL code is saved in the aflow.frozsl_input.out
 file.
 [FROZSL_MODE_PRESCRIPT]START
  script to be run before starting FROZSL
 [FROZSL_MODE_PRESCRIPT]STOP

--- IGNORE OPTIONS ---------------------------------------
[VASP_FORCE_OPTION]IGNORE_AFIX=STRINGS
  Activates/deactivates some parameters in aflow for VASP calculation,
  that are possible solutions to usual problems.
  Suggestion: do not specify these options unless you are willing to look into
  OUTCAR and vasp.out to check for troubles.
  They are all OPTIONALS. Possible keywords are:

 IGNORE_AFIX=STRING1,STRING2,... etc where STRINGS can be
